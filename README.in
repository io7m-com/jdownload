## jdownload

The `jdownload` package implements a trivial wrapper around the JDK HTTP client
providing downloads, checksum verification, and transfer statistics.

## Features

* Trivial HTTP file downloader providing transfer statistics.
* Automatic checksum verification for downloads.
* Low dependency: Requires Java 21 and uses [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/)
  for logging.
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/).
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System).
* ISC license.

## Usage

```
HttpClient client;
URI targetURI;
Path outputFile;
Path outputFileTemp;
```

Download a file from `targetURI`, writing the data temporarily to
`outputFileTemp` and then atomically replacing `outputFile` with
`outputFileTemp` if the download succeeds:

```
final var result =
  JDownloadRequests.builder(client, targetURI, outputFile, outputFileTemp)
    .build()
    .execute();
```

Perform the same download operation, but receive transfer statistics during
the download:

```
Consumer<STTransferStatistics> receiver;

final var result =
  JDownloadRequests.builder(client, targetURI, outputFile, outputFileTemp)
    .setTransferStatisticsReceiver(receiver)
    .build()
    .execute();
```

Perform the same download operation, but reject the download if the resulting
file does not match the given checksum:

```
final byte[] checksum =
  HexFormat.of()
   .parseHex("2d8bd7d9bb5f85ba643f0110d50cb506a1fe439e769a22503193ea6046bb87f7");

final var result =
  JDownloadRequests.builder(client, targetURI, outputFile, outputFileTemp)
    .setChecksumStatically("SHA-256", checksum)
    .build()
    .execute();
```

Perform the same download operation, but reject the download if the resulting
file does not match the checksum obtained from the given checksum URI:

```
Consumer<STTransferStatistics> receiver;
Path checksumFile;
Path checksumFileTemp;
URI checksumURI;

final var result =
  JDownloadRequests.builder(client, targetURI, outputFile, outputFileTemp)
    .setChecksumFromURL(checksumURI, "SHA-256", checksumFile, checksumFileTemp, receiver)
    .build()
    .execute();
```
